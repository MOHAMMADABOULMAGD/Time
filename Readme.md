# Clock with Dark Mode and Fullscreen Features

This project is a digital clock with a beautiful and responsive design. It includes features such as dark mode and fullscreen mode, with the dark mode state saved in local storage to persist across page reloads. The clock dynamically displays the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds, and indicates AM or PM.

## Features

- **Digital Clock**: Displays the current time with hours, minutes, seconds, and AM/PM indicators.
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes. The chosen theme is saved in the browser's local storage, so it persists even after refreshing the page.
- **Fullscreen Mode**: Switch to fullscreen mode for a distraction-free view. This can be toggled using a button or the 'F' key. The 'Escape' key exits fullscreen mode.
- **Responsive Design**: Uses CSS Grid and Flexbox for a responsive and aesthetically pleasing layout on all screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Markup language used for structuring the content.
- **CSS3**: Used for styling the HTML elements and providing the visual appearance, including the light and dark themes.
- **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity, including updating the clock, handling theme toggling, and managing fullscreen mode.
